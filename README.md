# Real-Time Object Detection Using TensorFlow and OpenCV

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a pre-trained TensorFlow model and OpenCV for webcam input. The model, trained on a custom dataset, predicts objects from the camera feed with confidence scores. This implementation utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize and classify objects in real-time.

## Status: Incomplete, Under Development

ðŸš§ **This project is currently incomplete and under active development.** ðŸš§

## Features

- Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for object detection.
- Integrates OpenCV for real-time webcam input and image processing.
- Displays predicted class labels and confidence scores for detected objects.
- Provides a flexible and extensible framework for custom object detection tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gauravsingh096/Object-detection.git
   cd Object-detection

Download the pre-trained model (keras_Model.h5) and labels (labels.txt) to the project directory.


Run main.py to start the object detection application:
python main.py

Adjust the camera source in the script (camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)) as needed.
